All the programs can be executed individually. Please check the code for the any “file name” you have to enter. These are few python codes of a bigger system which I haven’t made public. 

Execution Guidlines:
$ python <name of the program>

Some codes doesn’t have main method. For those you have to import them in your python program. For Instance :

import clean_tweets as ct

result=ct.performPreliminaryCleaning(word)
